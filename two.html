align-items:

align-items determines how items are aligned along the cross-axis of the flex container.
Values include flex-start (items align at the start of the cross axis), flex-end (items align at the end), center (items center along the cross axis), baseline (items align to their baselines), and stretch (items are stretched to fill the container).
<p><b>flex-direction:</b>

    flex-direction sets the main axis of the flex container, defining the direction in which flex items are placed.
    Values include row (items placed in a row, the main axis is horizontal), column (items placed in a column, the main axis is vertical), row-reverse (items placed in a row but in the opposite order), and column-reverse (items placed in a column but in the opposite order).</p>

        flex-wrap determines whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines within the flex container.
